    <a href="https://pt-br.reactjs.org/">üîó React Native CLI</a>
</h1>
<p align="center">üöÄ simple application developed with React Native CLI</p>

###  üèó  Running/Creating the project
```bash
# Create
$ npx react-native init orgsHook

# Install react native svg transformer for using an image as component
$ npm install react-native-svg-transformer

# Install Navigations - version 6.x
$ npm install @react-navigation/native@^6.x

# Install dependencies for Navigations
$ npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context

# Install tab navigation
$ npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs

# Install stack navigation
$ npm install @react-navigation/native-stack

# In my case I needed to install
$ npm i --save react-native-circular-progress react-native-svg && react-native link react-native-svg

# For IOS, install this another dependencie
$ npx pod-install ios

# Run Metro
$ npm start

# Run on android
$ npx react-native run-android

# Run on IOS
$ npx react-native run-ios
``` 
Navigation For Android, execute according to the steps informed in the article:
<a href="https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/#:~:text=react%2Dnative%2Dscreens%20package%20requires%20one%20additional%20configuration%20step%20to%20properly%20work%20on%20Android%20devices.%20Edit%20MainActivity.java%20file%20which%20is%20located%20in%20android/app/src/main/java/%3Cyour%20package%20name%3E/MainActivity.java" target="_blank">Docs</a>
###  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Important

Remember: if you download a project from scratch, run ```npm install``` commands to download node dependencies and, if running for iOS, ```cd ios && pod install``` to download native iOS dependencies.

In my case I needed to change Metro.config.js for this:

Old:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  transformer: {
    getTransformOptions: async () => ({
      transform: {
        experimentalImportSupport: false,
        inlineRequires: true,
      },
    }),
  },
};
```

Updated:
```javascript
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('metro-config');

module.exports = (async () => {
  const {
    resolver: { sourceExts, assetExts },
  } = await getDefaultConfig();
  return {
    transformer: {
      getTransformOptions: async () => ({
        transform: {
          experimentalImportSupport: false,
          inlineRequires: false,
        },
      }),
      babelTransformerPath: require.resolve('react-native-svg-transformer'),
    },
    resolver: {
      assetExts: assetExts.filter(ext => ext !== 'svg'),
      sourceExts: [...sourceExts, 'svg'],
    },
  };
})();
```

### üíø Technologies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [React Hooks](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Info
<b>componentDidMount:</b> which, as we have seen, is executed when the component finishes rendering;

<b>componentDidUpdate:</b> which is executed when the component receives an update and is not executed the first time the component loads;

<b>componentWillUnmount:</b> which is executed when the component is removed from the screen;

<b>componentDidCatch:</b> which is called when the application encounters an error during rendering, in some lifecycle method or in the constructor of child components.

<b>accessibilityLabel</b> = for visually impaired people to improve their interaction with the app

---

### Basic Hooks:

<b>useState:</b> used to manage states;

<b>useEffect:</b> used to generate side effects to certain updates;

<b>useContext:</b> used to manage contexts between different components.

---

### Additional Hooks:

<b>useReducer:</b> an alternative to useState when there are complex logics;

<b>useCallback:</b> memorizes a function, which is only updated when the values received as an argument are updated;

<b>useMemo:</b> similar to useCallback, but instead of a function, it stores a value;

<b>useRef:</b> normally used to access properties of ‚Äúchild‚Äù components;

<b>useImperativeHandle:</b> used to customize the instance value that will be accessible to the ‚Äúparent‚Äù components;

<b>useLayoutEffect:</b> similar to useEffect, but fired in the same phase as componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. UseEffect is preferred;

<b>useDebugValue:</b> used to set a "label" in custom hooks that will only appear in debug tools.

---

### Navigation Props:
<b>The reset navigation method:</b><br/>
When we use reset, all application navigation is restarted, as if the app had been opened again. We can pass parameters to this splash screen.
<br/><br/><b>The popToTop navigation method:</b><br/>
Using popToTop, we can pop all the screens and go back to the top of the stack, however, we are not able to pass parameters to this initial screen.
<br/><br/><b>The navigation method navigate:</b><br/>
In general, the navigate method is what we use the most to navigate from one screen to another - and it's what we used to stack the screens on our stack. But when we use the navigate to a screen that already exists on the stack, instead of stacking another identical screen, react-navigation removes the previous screens from the stack and reopens that specific screen. The effect is similar to pop or popToTop, however we are able to pass parameters when using navigate.
